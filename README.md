## What is Wecli?

Wecli turns a single chatbot into a **programmable multi-expert system**. You create a **Team** — a group of AI agents with distinct roles and personas — and let them collaborate on tasks through visual workflows. Each discussion builds a **living knowledge graph** that persists across sessions.

**Key concepts at a glance:**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Team** | A group of internal agents, external agents, and personas that work together |
| **OASIS** | The visual workflow engine that orchestrates multi-expert discussions (sequential, parallel, branching, DAG) |
| **OASIS Town** | A pixel-town visualization in the Studio sidebar where you watch live discussions and inspect the swarm graph |
| **WeBot** | A Claude-Code-style delegated runtime with role-based subagents, plan/todo/verification, and approval-aware tool policies |
| **GraphRAG** | A living knowledge graph built from each discussion, stored locally in SQLite (optionally mirrored to Zep) |
| **Team Presets** | 15 ready-to-use expert teams — strategists, content creators, tech titans, and more — installable in one click |
| **ACP (acpx)** | Agent Client Protocol for communicating with external AI agents (OpenClaw, Codex, Claude, Gemini, Aider) |
| **OpenClaw** | An external agent runtime that can be integrated into Teams alongside internal agents |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+** (for acpx and frontend builds)
- **Git**
- macOS / Linux / Windows (WSL or PowerShell)

### Install via AI Code CLI

Open any AI coding assistant such as **Codex**, **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, **CodeBuddy**, or **Trae**, and say:

```text
Clone https://github.com/WeCli/WeCli.git, read AGENTS.md, and install Wecli.
```

### Manual Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup</summary>

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
bash selfskill/scripts/run.sh start
# start automatically handles venv, dependencies, acpx, .env init, and service startup
# → Open http://127.0.0.1:51209
# → First login: passwordless on localhost (or use the Magic Link printed in terminal)
# → Setup wizard auto-appears if LLM not configured
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\selfskill\scripts\run.ps1 start
```

**Verify & manage services**

```bash
bash selfskill/scripts/run.sh status    # check all services
bash selfskill/scripts/run.sh stop      # stop all services
```

Open the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:51209`.

## Why Wecli

### Multi-Expert Collaboration, Not Just Chat

- **Team-based orchestration** — combine internal agents, OpenClaw agents, and external API agents into a single Team with one-click import/export
- **15 built-in Team Presets** — LLM Council, Nuwa All-Stars, Content Empire, Strategists, Tech Titans, and more — install and run immediately
- **AI team builder** — WeCli Creator discovers SOP pages, extracts roles with TinyFish, and generates editable personas plus a DAG workflow
- **Visual orchestration** — design workflows in OASIS with sequential, parallel, branching, or DAG-style expert coordination

### Claude-Code-Style Delegation with WeBot

- **Role-based subagents** — profiles for general, research, planner, coder, reviewer, and verifier modes
- **Persisted state** — run/task lifecycle, plan/todo/verification primitives, context compression, and artifact logging
- **Approval-aware tool policies** — configure which tools require human approval, with event logging and hooks
- **Bridge sessions** — real-time WebSocket connections between WeBot runtime and the UI

### Living Memory and Observability

- **GraphRAG** — every discussion builds a living knowledge graph, persisted locally with optional Zep mirroring
- **OASIS Town** — watch discussions unfold in a pixel-town visualization, inspect the swarm graph, and inject nudges in real time
- **ReportAgent** — ask why the current prediction leans a certain way and get graph-backed evidence

### Real Operator Features

- **OpenAI-compatible API** — local `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint that works with standard clients and MCP tools
- **Bots** — Telegram and QQ integrations with whitelist access control
- **Multimodal I/O** — images, files, voice input, TTS, provider-aware audio defaults
- **Automation** — scheduled tasks and long-running workflow execution
- **TinyFish** — internet search agent powered by TinyFish Web Agent API
- **Remote access** — Cloudflare Tunnel with login-token / password flows
- **Flow distribution** — browse and share workflows on [WecliHub](https://wecli.net)
